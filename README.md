Chrono Corp is a real-time simulation and strategy game about managing energy networks
across layers of time. The player works as a technician for Chrono Corp, a futuristic time-travel
agency that powers “time tourism” by stabilizing fragments of time known as Time Ripples.
Each minute of gameplay represents a full cycle: the current timeline duplicates. The new layer
becomes the present, while the previous one persists as the past — still active, simulated, and
influencing ongoing systems. These “time slices” accumulate over time, forming a web of
moments that must remain stable.
The player’s challenge is to maintain energy equilibrium across this growing network. Energy
flows both spatially between connected nodes in the same layer and temporally between
corresponding points across layers.
As the network expands, the game becomes a balancing act of causality and complexity.
Players must think in temporal depth, predicting how current and past configurations will echo
through time.
